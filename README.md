-----INSTALLING AND INITIALIZING:-----

1. Drag 'IdiotBox_latest.lua' and the 'bin' folder located in the .zip file into the following directory: Program Files (x86) > Steam > steamapps > common > GarrysMod > garrysmod > lua;
2. After injecting your 'sv_allowcslua' bypasser (look below), join a multiplayer server and type the following command in the console: 'lua_openscript_cl IdiotBox_latest.lua';
***If you are using a gLua loader, you will have to copy the script itself (which you can do by opening the .lua file with any text editor), paste it into the loader's console and execute it from there;
***If GitHub's servers are down and you cannot load IdiotBox, use the 'IdiotBox_backup.lua' file. The backup version does not load the script from GitHub, thus requiring manual updating when new versions come out;

-----HOW TO INJECT A BYPASSER:-----

There are a lot of methods out there for loading .lua scripts on servers that don't have 'sv_allowcslua' enabled. Some of these methods can change from time to time, as they get patched and replaced by others;
***If you are having trouble with loading IdiotBox or other .lua scripts on public servers, add me on Discord (Phizz#1667) and I will assist you as much as I possibly can;

-----REPORTING ISSUES:-----

If you encounter any bugs, errors or glitches while using IdiotBox, contact me through Discord (Phizz#1667) and I will assist you as much as I possibly can;
Alternatively, you can add me on Steam (https://steamcommunity.com/id/phizzofficial), however, my friends list is usually full and you might not be able to add me, but you can always leave a comment;

-----CREDITS:-----

Pasteware - Many of the basic features
Others - Smaller features

-----NOTES:-----

***To reiterate, DRAG BOTH 'IdiotBox_latest.lua' AND THE 'bin' FOLDER INTO THE AFOREMENTIONED DIRECTORY;
***The 'IdiotBox_dev.lua' file lets you access the currently work-in-progress version of IdiotBox - but as a heads up - it can be very buggy and unstable;

Happy Cheating!
